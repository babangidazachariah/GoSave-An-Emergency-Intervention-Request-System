GoSave: An Emergency Intervention Request System

Emergency intervention is necessary to minimize the degree and rate of damage or harm arising from emergency situations. However, intervention effectiveness is a function of timely and effective emergency information. The ability of victims providing timely and effective emergency information may be tempered with during emergency incidents. For example, victim may not be able to make a call, in the event the victim is able to dial a call but unable to speak, it is still not as effective as it should. Thus, GoSave provides emergency categories where a button press says it all.

GoSave was developed as a Java Client-Server Socket application. It allows for user Registration and Authentication. It provides public chat room as a socialiation platform as to keep users online in case of emergency request from any user.

GoSave was developed using Javafx for the interface design and JDBC for MySQL database connection for the purpose of user Registration and Authentication. Thus, the libraries are necessary for the application to run and allow for modification of the application.

NOTE that GoSave was developed as a simple application for the purpose of an assignment towards a course, ENGR5710G: Network Computing at the Ontario Tech University. Thus, it cannot claim to have adequately solve the ploblem. You may consider this as an idea, which may not to be necessirily solve the problem but its modification and adpatation may. Thus, you are advised not to directly implement GoSave, but to refine the requirements and implemention.
